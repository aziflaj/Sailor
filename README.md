# README

This is the 4th project for my **52 weeks, 52 projects** challenge. It is a sample API developed with a Node.js framework called [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/).

## Prerequisites
In order to use this application, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm (the Node Package Manager) installed and also a local [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) instance.

To install the dependencies and run the application, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g sails    # install the Sails CLI
$ npm install             # install the dependencies
$ sails lift              # start the app server
```

Finally, browse to [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337/) and see the application in action.
